üß† MedFusionNet: Hybrid CNN-LSTM for Disease Diagnosis

MedFusionNet is a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to diagnose diseases from medical data such as images, signals (e.g., ECG), or sequential patient records. This hybrid architecture harnesses the spatial feature extraction power of CNNs and the temporal modeling capabilities of LSTMs, making it highly suitable for medical diagnostic tasks involving time-dependent or multi-modal inputs.

üìå Project Overview

In this project, we:
	‚Ä¢	Built a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for disease classification.
	‚Ä¢	Applied the model to sequential or image-based medical data.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluated performance using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	‚Ä¢	Visualized confusion matrix and training performance.

üß† Model Architecture
	‚Ä¢	CNN Block: Extracts deep features from images or signal snapshots.
	‚Ä¢	LSTM Block: Models temporal dependencies or sequences (useful in patient history or time-series signal data).
	‚Ä¢	Fully Connected Layers: Classifies final disease outcome.

This architecture is especially useful for:
	‚Ä¢	ECG or EEG signal classification
	‚Ä¢	CT scan/MRI slice-based time-series
	‚Ä¢	Patient data with historical observations

üìÇ Dataset
	‚Ä¢	You can train MedFusionNet on:
	‚Ä¢	Medical images 
	‚Ä¢	Signal data 
	‚Ä¢	Patient sequential records

Dataset source: Kaggle, PhysioNet, NIH Chest X-ray, etc.
